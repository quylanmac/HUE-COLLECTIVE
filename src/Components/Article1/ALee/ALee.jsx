Interning with the lab allowed Alice to explore design in depth in a way she had never experienced before, exposing her to accessible design that was opposed to the typical idea of designing to make a profit, rather than helping people. The experience drew her into the kind of socially conscious design that she is so passionate about today, and remains her favorite experience with design thus far. </p>
