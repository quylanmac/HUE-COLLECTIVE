mission is to showcase different perspectives in design. So, we got together and talked about what design meant to each of us. We covered everything from our design inspirations to our most important learning experiences. In doing so, we were able to learn more about each other and our unique experiences with design. We hope you enjoy this interview! Thank you to Mylinh Lac, Braeanne Oribello, Lisa Zhou, Lwin DuMont, Adam Syed, Samantha Cheung, Justin Hwang, Amy An, Quylan Mac, and Alex Padayao for sharing. </p>\r\n                                <div className=\"responseVid interviewVid\" >\r\n                                     <ReactPlayer className=\"\" width={'100%'} maxHeight={'auto'} url={\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vr8cFwWLh90\"}\r\n                                    playIcon={<img src={require(`../../img/Issue2/playVideo.png`)} className=\"playResponse\"></img>}\r\n                                    controls={true} playing light={InterviewCover} ></ReactPlayer> \r\n                                    {/* <VideoPlayer\r\n                                        ref={p => this.player = p}\r\n                                        containerWidth={this.state.windowWidth}\r\n                                        containerHeight={this.state.windowHeight}\r\n                                        src={\"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/quylanmac/HUE-COLLECTIVE/progress/src/img/promo.mp4\"}\r\n                                        poster={InterviewCover}\r\n                                        onPlay={this.handleOnPlay}\r\n                                        onPause={this.handleOnPause}\r\n                                        onMute={this.handleOnMute}\r\n                                        onUnmute={this.handleOnUnmute}\r\n                                        onTimeUpdate={this.handleTimeUpdate}\r\n                                        startTime={0}\r\n                                        autoPlay={false}\r\n                                        volume={0.5}\r\n                                        loop={false}\r\n                                        onEnd={this.toggleMute}\r\n                                        className={this.state.isPlaying ?

Hello, my name is Alex and I think to my bottom right thats Amy\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Hello, I am Amy and we’re writers for HUE Collective and today we will be interviewing HUE members on their inspiration\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex: So everyone, our wonderful HUE staff please introduce yourself one by one starting from the top left and we’ll work our way like in a little snake pattern\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: My top left is Mylinh Lac\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex: Mine’s as well. Let’s start with Mylinh\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMylinh: I’m Mylinh. I’m one of the co-creative directors here at HUE. I’m a rising junior majoring in Cognitive Science for design and minoring in urban studies and planning\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBri: I’m Bri. Also the other co-creative director for HUE. I’m an incoming junior majoring in cognitive science - design and interaction and minoring in ethnic studies\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLisa: I’m Lisa. I’m a rising sophomore. I'm the marketing “coordinator” but I can take on any title related to marketing. I’m a cognitive science major, sorry I just blanked out completely, and possibly doing a minor in ICAM but currently rethinking that decision\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLwin: Hi, Im Lwin i'm a rising junior and I’m an editor and sometimes writer here at HUE and I am  a chemical engineering major\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAdam: Hello, I’m Adam. I’m a User Experience designer at HUE and I am a rising Junior studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in design. And I don't have any minors\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSamantha: Hello, I’m Samantha. I’m basically the same as Adam. Same credentials, same major. The same as Adam, UX designer\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex: Phenomenal, next we have Quylan Mac\r\n<br /><br />\r\nQuylan: Hi, I’m Quylan Mac. Incoming Third Year. I am a developer at HUE and my major is Computer Science\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Ok Great. Can everyone tell me what inspired you to pursue design or join HUE\r\n<br /><br />\r\nQuylan: Wait, can someone else go first?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex: I got this, I came ready\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex:“For me the main reason I joined was because of fashion. At the time, I was doing intramural basketball and I was following the NBA more so a lot of what I thought design was through fashion. Like if you look at NBA guys like Russell Westbrook, PJ Tucker, guys like that, they have such let's say different, like really out there outfits. So for me I think that’s something that really drew me into HUE. LIke maybe exploring stuff like that. And then after a while I think I realized that doing interviews and interviewing other people. Some people we interviewed were healthcare people or even in music. So I think that wide variety of design is really what not only made me want to join HUE but also want to stay on more and bring more awareness to what design is”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: “Thank you for that, now who would like to go next?”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nQuylan: Ok I’ll go, I just thought it was the perfect opportunity for me  to expand upon my skills and also create something with all my friends. Because I didn’t even know in the beginning about design then I realized that there are a bunch of different fields like UI/UX, architecture, sound and I thought that was really cool and a lot of people like me wouldn’t know what those fields are if it weren’t for HUE to showcase those aspects. So yea, that's why I joined HUE\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: That is so touching, that really brings tears to my eyes. Thank you so much for that  wonderful insight Quylan. Would anyone like to build off of that. Thank you Adam for volunteering yourself.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAdam: I dont think anyone can beat that statement, its really touching. I kind of got into design when the first iPhone was released. So it was when no, I didnt get into UX design and all of that\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: When you were seven? Oh my gosh, wow!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAdam: No, I was interested. I was always thinking about how these apps are going on the phone and how these apps appear on the app store. So that's when I started learning about programming. And then when I started learning about programming, I wanted to make apps and when I was making apps I was just so frustrated because those apps that I built were just so badly designed. There was no foundation behind the apps in terms of design and that's how I learned about design on my own through online courses. Only when I got to UCSD, I kind of got immersed with other different fields in design.  Yeah, thats kind of how I got involved\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: That was so beautiful. I loved how you got started at such a young age. Would anyone else like to talk about how they got started in design.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBri: I can talk I guess\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Thank you Bri\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBri: “Pretty much, I’ll just talk about what HUE came from and why I decided to start it. But really emphasizing storytelling and community building and trying to bring people together to sort of hear each other’s stories and bring that human aspect to the university because I feel like UCSD is super tech-based and sometimes your creativity is pressured to make something out of it or profit off of it somehow but in reality that not always the case about creativity.  You can just express yourself or like meet other people through it. So, yea\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Beautiful, Beautiful. Well spoken Bri. Would the other co-creative director like to add on to that\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMylinh: “Sure yeah. I guess in terms of design, I think it was the end of HS when I was figuring out what I wanted to apply to college as. So I thought about careers that included creativity and came across product design and that’s kind of what I was applying to at that point., so that was like cognitive science. I came into UCSD in Speculative Design because I thought that's what led into product design, but it was not so I changed majors freshman year into cognitive science..I think at that point I was doing projects for other clubs and it felt kinda more structured where it was just  a design process that we know of and I think even with classes and things, I wanted more of an outlet where I can explore other initiatives in the creative realm. So yea, that’s why I decided to join HUE, it's really exciting. A lot of our team is not in the conventional design area to so it's really fun to work with everyone”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Wonderful insight. Who would like to go next?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBri: I think Lwin raised his hand. Or Lisa. Go\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLisa Zhou: This year I also took a VIS class where I got into using the Adobe Creative Suite and like poster making and really thinking about graphic design and another subset of design more art and creative based. And so when Bri was like “Oh we have a HUE one, we have some positions that are open”, I was like, “I have no idea what this is but this sounds really creative and cool” and so I can like use my big brain thinking about the fundamentals of design and  how do we reshape systems but then at the same time I can also be like I wanna make some really cool and really cute little graphics, help promote this really cool zine and I feel like I've been able to find outlets in both like a big brain thinky perspective as well as a more fun, more creative little group of people. Yeah”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: That was so good, that was really cute actually.  Thank you for that Lisa. Alright, who wants to go next?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLwin: I don’t know who you’re pointing to, but I don’t think I’ve gone yet so I can go. I joined to gain a different perspective on how to solve a problem because engineering has so many different disciplines but like the way they teach you to go through things can be very rigid sometimes. So I’ve just really appreciated learning different ways of thinking  and showing how important it is to consider different communities' opinions and experiences when trying to solve a problem. I hope to bring that in my own career and I like helping out others and I also like to write and edit a lot so it's in my rule.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Alright, and now would Sam like to wrap it up\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSamantha: Yes. Sorry, I’m currently crocheting\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSamantha: I came into college, well actually I came in as a Cog Sci Design and Interaction major because I kinda knew that's what I wanted to do when I was applying to colleges so I was excited to come in here. Didn’t really know that I would be doing UI or UX design but that's kinda what I found that I liked most so I kept sticking  with that and I’m very glad to be part of this organization, this group of friends, this creative team. I met Mylinh because of Design for America (she was on my team) and then she introduced me to Bri when we did the designathon and then they asked me if I wanted to help do this and I was like, “Yes Please”, because I loved working with you guys for Designathon I wanted to keep designing with you guys.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLisa: I would also like to add that Design Frontiers, forgot to mention, is where I met Bri, Mylinh, and Amy. and Adam we all worked on a team. So shout out hackathons for bringing us together as well as design co.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAmy: Thank you everyone for this round of questions. Really great information.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlex: I think, just to sum everything up, I think all of us kind of took a big step forward.

How did you get into design?</b>\r\n                                        <br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                                I came from a first generation family with no formal education. Growing up, I watched my mother work as a fashion designer who created clothes from end to end. I observed her as she went through her design process and this was my first exposure to design. After I entered college, the biggest reason for why I'm pursuing design as a first generation college student is because education is something that I'm really passionate about. I use design as a medium to speak on and do things that I like which intersects with education. For me, design is a means to an end of doing things that are the most fulfilling that I find for myself.\r\n                                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                                        <b>\r\n                                            Q2.

Working remotely and feeling judged solely on my output is definitely something to consider for my future goals in design. Ultimately, I’m planning on working as a product designer for a few years before starting my own projects that align with my goals of using design to make a meaningful impact.\r\n                                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                                        <b>\r\n                                            Q3.

I got involved in design not through classes or opportunities but just by talking to people. I’ve met many young talented designers at UCSD who taught me a lot about design and helped me get further involved in the design community at UCSD. In my experience, there are a lot of people who are just willing to have candid conversations on design and how to get involved in UCSD’s design community.\r\n                                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                                        <b>\r\n                                            Q4.

I enjoyed working end to end with my team in order to create the final solution. In my opinion, the real world impact and opportunity to actually help someone is more rewarding than the letter grade attached.\r\n\r\n                                COGS 127: Designing Human-Data Interactions\r\n                                In my opinion, this class distinguishes itself from other classes by being relentlessly practical. It really helped me to find internships within the design industry. I also appreciated the critique on other design classes.\r\n                                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                                        <b>\r\n                                            Q5.

I read articles about design every single day. There are so many articles on Medium and other online resources that have valuable information on design and the industry. I also connected with designers online and in person which was really impactful for me. I highly recommend having a group of designers to talk to. As students, we may not know how to start since there are so many different paths to take within design. Talking with friends allowed us to explore these paths together, asking each other questions and learning from each other.\r\n                                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                                        <b>\r\n                                            Q6.

Between the International Health Collective and RE:dsgn, Lauren has had significant experience working with children, learning that younger students don’t need concepts to be simplified for them to understand.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col md={4} xs={5}>\r\n                            <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                <img className=\"cursor listicker5\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/starsticker.png')} />\r\n                            </Draggable>\r\n                                <img style={{maxWidth:\"100%\"}} src={require('./pic2.png')}></img>\r\n                                \r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={8} xs={7}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraphbig\">In her experience, Lauren found it best to push her younger students rather than allowing educators’ pre-existing biases about disadvantaged communities limit their curriculum.</p>\r\n                                <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor listicker6\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/leafsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                            <p className=\"paragraph\">As she grew into her journey as a designer, Lauren found inspiration in those closest to her.

Jacobs’ advocacy of Urban Planning on a <span className=\"paragraphbig\">human scale</span> can be seen in Sophie’s mentality.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        \r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col md={4} xs={4}>\r\n                            <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor sksticker5\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/shootingstarsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                                <img className=\"pic4\" src={require('./pic4.png')}></img>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={8} xs={8}>\r\n                                <p style={{marginTop:\"3rem\"}} className=\"paragraphbig\">Urban design is very important for Sophie because in this age where everything is digitized, it is easy to lose sight of the nuances of design that can benefit the community and the environment at the same time.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Along with this, she talks about the problems of <span className=\"paragraphbig\">stratification</span> of communities:  “what can go where, depends on how we communicate and how stratification and hierarchies are reinforced.” This presents the problem of stratification, according to her, “<span className=\"paragraphbig\">...land use</span> determines what kind of industries and structure goes where.” The main hurdle for Sophie’s work is stratification that creates <span className=\"paragraphbig\">inaccessible land</span>.

className=\"paragraph\">Jonah Wolf, a third year Economics major with Accounting and Business minors, boasts more than just an extensive knowledge in the world of economics. In fact, Jonah utilizes his creative talents in a medium much different than statistical models or economic methods. Rather, he makes <span className=\"paragraphbig\">beats</span>. During our interview with Jonah, we were able to learn more about his journey as well as the versatility he brings to the table. Jonah got his start in music from a very young age, starting with the drums then transitioning into guitar and eventually beat making when he was in the 12th grade. After taking a hiatus, Jonah rekindled his passion for beat making after enrolling in UCSD. His experience has led him to produce a versatile array of beats as for him, <span className=\"paragraphbig\">“It’s about sharing ideas and music”</span>.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col md={2} xs={2}>\r\n                            <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor jwsticker1\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/notesticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={10} xs={10}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraphbig\">When creating his beats, Jonah’s main concern is getting to a place that the artists he collaborates with can love.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"regularrow\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">During the beat making process, Jonah uses FL Studio, a digital audio workspace that allows him to combine various musical elements such as <span className=\"paragraphbig\">keyboards, organs, drums, and even electronic sounds</span> to produce beats that he then sends out to various artists to experiment with and refine. His beats span a <span className=\"paragraphbig\">variety of genres</span>, from Lo-Fi to contemporary R&B, and he credits his inspiration to the different artists that he collaborates with during the music making process alongside his own personal inspirations. When specifying some of these inspirations, Jonah credits Taio Cruz’s 2009 smash hit Dynamite as well as various artists of today such as Kanye West, Travis Scott, Young Thug, Thaiboy Digital, 100 gecs, JPEGMAFIA, and Mozart. </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Jonah’s devotion to beat making has also led him to be involved in the <span className=\"paragraphbig\">Producers & Remixers Organization (PRO) Club</span> at UCSD, which gave him valuable information with working on digital  audio workspaces as well as a great community to learn from.  </p>\r\n                                <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor jwsticker2\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/emeraldsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Jonah’s work can be found across various online platforms and specifically, his work with his own music collective, <span className=\"paragraphbig\">Housemoney</span>, truly showcases Jonah’s multifaceted talent. Co-founded with fellow UCSD alum Damian Ngo, Jonah is focusing on creating his own music as well as connecting and collaborating with other artists, some of which are from UCSD.  With a strong line of communication between both himself and the artists, he is able to utilize his skills in beat making to <span className=\"paragraphbig\">create works of art that seamlessly complement  the talents of his artists</span>. Housemoney isn’t solely limited to collaboration but also producing original music, instrumentals and playlists for the avid music fan to experience. Some of Housemoney’s productions include curated monthly playlists on Spotify and various instrumentals on Youtube, some of which have garnered over 500,000 views.  </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"regularrow\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <img className=\"singleimage\" style={{maxWidth:\"60%\"}} src={require('./pic1.png')}></img>\r\n                                <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor jwsticker3\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/randomsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">For Jonah, beat making isn’t only about the end result, but also the future. He is passionate about sharing his own music as well as seeing other artists grow and he hopes to continue working with other  artists and contributing to their sound. When balancing beat making with school, he suggests time management and a strict schedule interlaced with time for rest and relaxation.

Despite this disadvantage, Alicia still managed to <span className=\"paragraphbig\">find mentors</span> in the discipline, citing UCSD professors Teddy Cruz and Brett Stalbaum as individuals who helped her navigate her major change and dive into <span className=\"paragraphbig\">urban ecology</span> and <span className=\"paragraphbig\">public culture</span>.  On any given day, Alicia utilizes a menagerie of tools to create her <span className=\"paragraphbig\">models and designs</span>. For 3-D modeling, programs such as Revit, AutoCad, and SketchUp offer a variety of amenities for both novel and expert designers.  The Adobe Suite is the industry standard for visual designs, and to round out her skills, Alicia can write in Python to meet any of her coding needs.

Harry describes that the ultimate goal of urban design is to <span className=\"paragraphbig\">design better ways for people to occupy a space</span>. This can be through a democratization of space, funding, and resources. At UC San Diego, Harry describes the major as <span className=\"paragraphbig\">broad with different focuses</span> such as policy, public health, and environmental studies. </p>\r\n                                <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                        <img className=\"cursor hlsticker2\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/openbooksticker.png')} />\r\n                                    </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">He recommends all three lower division USP classes which teach students the history of urban communities. Issues such as how the cities were <span className=\"paragraphbig\">designed and built unequally</span> are brought to light especially through infrastructure and resources such as <span className=\"paragraphbig\">highways and community resources</span>. Additionally, Harry enjoys the book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” by Jane Jacobs.

In addition to his iconic designs and deep impact in the field of architecture, he is remembered for his statements such as “less is more” and “God is in the details.” On the daily, Harry’s go-to tools are reading and writing.

Keep in mind that decisions you make as a planner <span className=\"paragraphbig\">won’t be seen for decades</span>. Urban planning has much more than designers. In terms of environmental design, <span className=\"paragraphbig\">you need to know what you’re designing</span>. Use expertise as a planner to find the best solution. Urban design is best <span className=\"paragraphbig\">paired with another focus</span> in order to see the connections between other areas of study.

Currently, she’s working on a project to help older adults shop for high-tech devices even if they can’t get to the store, a product of her love for <span className=\"paragraphbig\">inclusive design</span> aimed at people whose needs often aren’t accommodated in product design.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Alice wasn’t always so sure about pursuing design; she was initially looking into a <span className=\"paragraphbig\">career in business</span> because of its universal application, but she has since taken up <span className=\"paragraphbig\">social design research</span> because of its impact on marginalized groups.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col md={5} xs={4}>\r\n                                <img className=\"alpic1\" src={require('./pic1.png')}></img>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={7} xs={8}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraphbig\">She’s especially interested in designing for people with diabetes and other medical conditions, which she believes is an important consideration for designing a better world. </p>\r\n                                <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor alsticker2\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/carsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Since declaring her CogSci major, Alice has been able to engage with design firsthand through several internships. While <span className=\"paragraphbig\">studying abroad</span> in Hong Kong, she worked for a social design lab where she researched sound, lighting, and building structures to facilitate better learning among <span className=\"paragraphbig\">special needs students</span>. Interning with the lab allowed Alice to explore design in depth in a way she had never experienced before, exposing her to accessible design that was opposed to the typical idea of designing to make a profit, rather than helping people. The experience drew her into the kind of socially conscious design that she is so passionate about today, and remains her favorite experience with design thus far. </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col md={7} xs={7}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Alice also worked as a research intern for HP, where she researched <span className=\"paragraphbig\">augmented technologies</span>, specifically using augmented reality to provide real time information on how to repair computers.

In Edric’s case, he creates a specific noise then modulates it to his desire to produce a wide array of sounds. One of the tools Edric uses when modulating his sound is FL Studio, a digital audio workstation that allows him to experiment with <span className=\"paragraphbig\">various pitches, tones, and instruments</span> that eventually combine together to compose music. Another tool he uses is SERUM, an Advancer Wavetable Synthesizer, that is considered to be the gold standard for EDM, and goes more in depth with <span className=\"paragraphbig\">sound modulation</span> with 3D wavetables and oscillators. </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"smallrow\">\r\n                            <Col md={9} xs={9}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">Looking into Edric’s main focus, sound design falls into two categories, <span className=\"paragraphbig\">mixing and mastering</span>. Mixing is the first step of music production, taking different aspects of music such as vocals, instrumentals etc. to create a desired end <span className=\"paragraphbig\">set of sound</span>. This can include combining 808 drums, specific piano chords, and even samples together then further refining the combination of these elements through processes such as equalization (EQ) and panning. Mastering is the final step of producing sound, the “debugging” of music production, <span className=\"paragraphbig\">optimizing the sound</span> for our listening pleasure. Some of Edric’s work has also been showcased in DVC, a DJ club at UCSD, which he acknowledges in helping him learn how to DJ faster.</p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col md={3} xs={3}>\r\n                            <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor eosticker2\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/cometsticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"regularrow\">\r\n                            <Col md={2} xs={2}>\r\n                            <Draggable {...dragHandlers}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"cursor eosticker3\" draggable=\"false\" src={require('../Pictures/Cover/generalpics/firesticker.png')} />\r\n                                </Draggable>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={10} xs={10}>\r\n                                <p className=\"paragraph\">It’s easy to overlook or generalize sound design, but it’s just as important as any other aspect of design. It’s <span className=\"paragraphbig\">utilization of various tools and resources</span> in manipulating sound provides more than <span className=\"paragraphbig\">sensory experience</span>, but also a story that taps into our <span className=\"paragraphbig\">deepest human thoughts and emotions</span>. Without it, those experiences from films or music that we take for granted would cease to exist. When talking about the future of his field, Edric intuitively <span className=\"paragraphbig\">predicts</span> that EDM will go into old tribal drum patterns, similar to those of the Aztecs or Mayans. Some of Edric’s inspirations include Madeon and Daft Punk, both of which are monumental artists in the <span className=\"paragraphbig\">electric art</span> genre. </p>\r\n

interested in the field of architecture and urban design. This club welcomes students from all majors, backgrounds, and experiences. We host software workshops (such as SketchUp, CAD, and Revit), professional speaker events, and site visits. We also have a project team that redesigns certain areas on campus from a student perspective and presents these plans to the UCSD Campus Planning Board. Our project team is usually active from the beginning of winter quarter to the end of spring quarter. For this 2020-21 school year, Architecture@UCSD will be withholding official activities and member recruitment until Winter 2021.</p>\r\n                                </Row>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <Row className=\"horizontal_scroll justifyEnd\">\r\n                            <HashLink smooth to=\"/groupinterview\" className=\"\">\r\n                                <img src={groupButton} className=\"end2Button responseImg2\" />\r\n                            </HashLink>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Container>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default connect(null, { setTheme })(Architecture);\r\n","import React, { Component, useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\r\nimport '../FA20.css';\r\nimport { setTheme } from '../../../redux/actions';\r\nimport Directory from '../Directory.jsx';\r\nimport './DFA.css';\r\nimport { HashLink } from 'react-router-hash-link';\r\nimport GroupInterview from '../../GroupInterview/GroupInterview';\r\nimport groupButton from '../../../img/Issue2/button.png';\r\nimport Empowerment from '../../Empowerment/Empowerment';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport arrows3 from './Pictures/Arrows3.svg';\r\nimport logo from './Pictures/DFAlogo.svg';\r\n\r\nclass DFA extends Component {\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n    }\r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n        document.body.className = \"darktheme\";\r\n        this.props.setTheme('black');\r\n        // window.scrollTo(0,0);\r\n    }\r\n    componentWillUnmount() {\r\n        document.body.className = \"\";\r\n        this.props.setTheme('black');\r\n    }\r\n    handleTheme(theme) {\r\n        this.props.setTheme(theme);\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        const parent = { width: `100%`, height: `100%` }\r\n        const child = { width: `1110px`, height: `100%` }\r\n        return (\r\n            <Container className=\"container-fluid\">\r\n                <div style={parent} className=\"row nopad\">\r\n                    <div className=\"viewResponsive sec1\" id=\"section1\">\r\n                        <Row className=\"nopad\">\r\n                            <Col md={4}>\r\n                                <Link to={{ pathname: \"/issue2\" }}>\r\n                                    <Row md={2}>\r\n                                        <Col md={12} className=\"issue_2\">\r\n                                            <p>ISSUE 2</p>\r\n                                            <p>PLUGGED IN</p>\r\n                                        </Col>\r\n                                    </Row>\r\n                                </Link>\r\n                                <Row xs={10} md={10}>\r\n                                    <Col xs={4} md={4}>\r\n                                    <Row className=\"plug_1_row\">\r\n                                            <img className=\"plug_1\" src={require('../Plug2.svg')} />\r\n                                        </Row>\r\n                                        {/* <Row>\r\n                                                <img className=\"outlet\" src={require('../Outlet.svg')} />\r\n                                            </Row> */}\r\n                                    </Col>\r\n\r\n                                    <Col xs={8} md={8}>\r\n                                        <Row md={9}>\r\n                                            <Directory />\r\n                                        </Row>\r\n                                        <HashLink smooth to=\"/issue2/design-for-america#club\">\r\n                                        <Row md={3}>\r\n                                            <Col md={12} className=\"down_arrow\">\r\n                                                <img src={require('./Pictures/whitearrow.svg')} />\r\n                                            </Col>\r\n                                        </Row>\r\n                                        </HashLink>\r\n                                    </Col>\r\n                                </Row>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n\r\n                            <Col md={3} id=\"club\">\r\n                                <Row>\r\n                                    <p className=\"dfa_text\">We design people-centered products, services, and experiences to tackle local challenges.

challenge focused on bringing together our community and leveraging collective intelligence to address complex issues in the San Diego region. D4SD 2020 focused on how to improve the safety, emotional health, and economic prosperity of all San Diegans during the COVID pandemic. We support inclusion by all ages, skill-levels, and cultural backgrounds by motivating hundreds of diverse citizens to take part in facilitated activities, stakeholder research, and brainstorming to create design proposals for how to enact positive change in our region. D4SD has provided a unique position to make direct social impacts, while also advancing research on \"collective innovation\", where we explore how we can organize collective action through design

impact on American lives far outreaches that of smores.\r\n                            This summer camp, known as <span style={{color: \"#76B19F\"}} className=\"corbenBold\">Camp Jened</span>, and it’s campers challenged the American government into rethinking the way we\r\n                            interact with our society by spurring a nationwide movement for disabled rights that played a pivotal part in the\r\n                            passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. The ADA not only gave America’s disabled protection from\r\n                            discrimination, but also accomidations within existing structures not designed with them in mind, such as <span style={{color: \"#76B19F\"}} className=\"corbenBold\">elevators\r\n                            and curb cuts. </span>Camp Jened’s efforts were spearheaded by its campers, who were predominantly high school to college-aged\r\n                            students with disabilities, and it was their call to action that brought awareness to the importance of equitable design.\r\n                            The campers of Camp Jened brought attention to equitable design through demonstration, and today’s designers continue to\r\n                            provide solutions to the problems raised by Camp Janed almost 30 years ago, reimagining how everyday objects can be redesigned.\r\n                            Yet how exactly are these designers redesigning these objects and furthermore what has been done? To answer this question,\r\n                            we first have to understand the concept of <span className=\"designCircle\">Universal Design. </span>\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n                <Row className=\"universalDesign  mobilePadding\">\r\n                    {/* Leftmost whitespace*/}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnLeft\" md={2}>\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <div className=\"articleLabels\">\r\n                                <p className=\"headerText\">Universal Design</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Seperator whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" md={7}>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                Universal design. This idea is thrown around often, but what does it truly entail? By definition, the concept of universal\r\n                                design promises to offer <span style={{color:\"#5E53D9\"}}  className=\"corbenBold\">accessibility and function to anyone regardless of their age, size, ability, or disability.</span> Looking\r\n                                at architecture, it is evident that though some may believe that the foundation of a building lies within its materials,\r\n                                it really should be the inclusivity in design. Access to architecture is not a privilege that only some are allowed; it is a\r\n                                right that must be kept at the forefront of thought. This sentiment was recognized as far back as Camp Jened.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n                                Larry Allison, an able-bodied counselor at Camp Janed, expressed how at Camp Janed they realized that the problem of inaccessibility\r\n                                fell on those without disabilities.  As society evolves, so must our ability to be flexible and innovative, not because it is being forced,\r\n                                but because it's necessary. Many of the changes required to be more inclusive do not require a grandiose amount of wealth, resources,\r\n                                and time, but rather <span style={{color:\"#5E53D9\"}} className=\"corbenBold\">small tweaks that will have large scale impacts</span>- maybe a handrail is built, maybe a layout is changed. While\r\n                                implementing changes for disabled persons, it is crucial to remember that disability cannot be seen just by looking at someone: \r\n                                <span style={{color:\"#5E53D9\"}} className=\"corbenBold\"> disability can be a visual, cognitive, or auditory impairment, not just mobile. </span>We have begun to truly see the concept of universal\r\n                                design in motion in places such as the Fleet Library in the Rhode Island School of Design and the Hazelwood School located in Glasgow.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n                <Row className=\"fleetlibrary  mobilePadding\">\r\n                    {/* Leftmost whitespace*/}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnLeft\" md={2}>\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <div className=\"articleLabels\">\r\n                                <p className=\"headerText\">Fleet Library + The Hazelwood School </p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Seperator whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" md={7}>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <Col xs={12} md={7} className=\"noPad\"><p className=\"articleText\">\r\n                                The Fleet Library, founded in 1878, was redesigned under the guidance of Monica Ponce de Leon and her architecture and design firm\r\n                                Office dA in 2006. Ponce de Leon, a Venezuelan-American who immigrated to the US in the 1980’s, discussed with NPR how she incorporated\r\n                                universal design in her work. One of the most notable designs to the Fleet Library was its <span style={{color:\"#76B19F\"}}  className=\"corbenBold\">cubicles</span>, which varied subtly in size and shape.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col xs={0} md={1}/>\r\n                            <Col xs={12} md={4} className=\"fleetlibrarycubicle\" ><img src={fleetlibrarycubicle} className=\"imageBox mobileImage\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n      \r\n                            <p className=\"articleText\">\r\n                                Ponce de Leon explained how this difference was intentional, hoping to “accommodate many different body types in a very subtle way”.\r\n                                Her design encompassed various principles of universal design, some of which included size and space for approach and use as well as\r\n                                being simple and intuitive. The Fleet Library’s cubicles were designed for people with different types of needs to enjoy the same benefit\r\n                                that they provide, an ample learning environment. A person in a wheelchair could comfortably sit in one of the cubicles, and a small child\r\n                                could sit in the same cubicle and not feel the difference. De Leon’s process represents an application of universal design on a small scale,\r\n                                but universal design can also be applied in a bigger scope. The Hazelwood School for the multiple sensory impaired in Glasgow, Scotland applies\r\n                                these principles, but in a way that can be accessible to children with special needs to learn.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                            <Col xs={12} md={4} className=\"corktrailrail\"><img src={corktrailrail} className=\"imageBox mobileImage\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col xs={12} md={8} className=\"noPad\"><p className=\"articleText\">\r\n                                The school, which was opened in 2007, answered the challenge of universal design through intuitive features in its architecture,\r\n                                both internal and external.

One of their newest additions has been a sensory room that is another mode for learning. The Hazelwood\r\n                                school has been crucial to a new generation of design projects for young people with special needs such as autism.\r\n                                Designs such as these hope to encourage and exercise independence and free learning amongst the children in a secure environment.\r\n                                For both the Fleetwood library and the Hazelwood school, there is always room for more improvement and increased inclusivity.\r\n                                Newer generations of designers can take inspiration from these pieces of

The process of combining professional experience with community expertise and participation became known overall as community design. In 1973, a group of architectural students from UC Berkeley, organized as Asian Neighborhood Design, set out to design for the Asian communities of the Bay area, <span className=\"community_bold\">initially focusing on both San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatowns.</span> As they expanded, they branched out into various projects, engaging community members and creating both educational and vocational opportunities.</p>\r\n                                </Col>\r\n                            </Row>\r\n                            <Row>\r\n                                <Col md={3}>\r\n                                    <img className=\"community_pic\" src={building}/>\r\n                                </Col>\r\n\r\n                                <Col md={9}>\r\n                                    <p className=\"community_design_font\">One of their earliest major projects was the renovation of what would come to be known as the <span className=\"community_bold\">Asian Resource Center (ARC),</span> located within Oakland’s Chinatown. Collaborating with the East Bay Asian Local Development Corp, AND volunteers directed the renovations of the 1924 terra cotta building, developing several community programs in the process.

Thus, the project Beyond the Castle was established in an effort to renovate the open area into some sort of community space. The city council wanted the general public to help brainstorm the specifics of what the community space could be. However, people believed the decision on how to revamp the land was already made and dismissed any outreach as “an exercise in communicating the decisions already made.” Thus, a group of hired designers came up with five implementable methods to promote community involvement for the project. </p>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <div className=\"willThisWork\" style={{display:\"flex\"}}>\r\n                            <img src={cellphone} className=\"community_phone displayCenter\"/>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col className=\"cancer_column\">\r\n                                <p className=\"community_design_font1 cancer\">1.

Ethical design is made with the intent to do good. It concerns moral behavior and responsibility in design. To understand why this is important, let’s reflect on some current issues in the way technology is designed. Oftentimes human behavior is exploited by design, creating unwanted habits and negative consequences for the user (ex. social media addiction). Other times, design prioritizes the interests of the company at the cost of their users (ex. surveillance capitalism). As we educate ourselves to be the next generation of designers, here are some general guidelines on how we can design technology more ethically. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n                <Row className=\"introduction2 mobilePadding myTest\">\r\n                    <Col md={3}/>\r\n                    <Col md={1}><img src={glove} className=\"backgroundImageBox glove glove2\"/></Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" xs={12} md={7}>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText newQuestion\">\r\n                            <p className=\"articleQuestion\">1.

For example, this might look like brainstorming features that create a more accessible experience or exploring different solutions that benefit everyone.

Moral Value Maps are a great tool for aligning the team’s values and making sure that everyone from the designers, company leaders, and stakeholders are on the same page about the ethics of their design. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"captionText\">\r\n                            {/*\r\n                            <Col md={2}></Col>\r\n                            <Col md={8}>\r\n                            <img src={moralValue} className=\"smallImageBox mobileImage\" />\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col md={2}></Col> */}\r\n                            <div className=\"willThisWork\">\r\n                            <img src={moralValue} className=\"smallImageBox mobileImage\" />\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"captionText\">\r\n                            <a href=\"https://www.ethicsfordesigners.com/moral-value-map\" target=\"_blank\">An example of a moral value map</a>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n\r\n                <Row className=\"thirdSection mobilePadding\">\r\n                    {/* Leftmost whitespace*/}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnLeft\" md={2}>\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Seperator whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}><img src={cellphone} className=\"backgroundImageBox glove cellphone\"/></Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" md={7}>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText beginQuestion\">\r\n                            <p className=\"articleQuestion\">4.

While good ethical design creates a better experience for the user, dark patterns in design are used to manipulate the user experience in order to benefit the company. Some examples include sneaking items into your cart, trick questions, privacy zuckering, and misdirection.

This approach can be applied to many different facets of design. Now, we’ll be taking a deeper look at what design ethics means for presenting information. </p>\r\n                            <p className=\"articleText\"> When developing consumer-oriented technological media, some major ethical concerns involve how people’s information is handled and presented. The goal here is to maintain honesty and visibility. The consumer should have an easy time discerning what information is presented to them, and it would be ethically responsible to avoid misdirecting their attention or deceiving them. Statistics don’t lie, but they can definitely be used to lead people the wrong way. Here are a few ideas and examples on how to incorporate ethical design choices. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText newQuestion\">\r\n                            <div className=\"willThisWork\" style={{display:\"flex\"}}>\r\n                            <img src={sparkle} className=\"tinyImageBox sparkle1  displayCenter\"/>\r\n                            <p className=\"articleQuestion\">Visualize your data</p>\r\n                            <img src={sparkle} className=\"tinyImageBox sparkle2  displayCenter\" />\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>When displaying data, using visuals like charts, graphs, and pictures generally capture the attention of the user more than words or a set of text would. Not only can data be presented in a more clear and concise fashion, but it can also generate more curiosity in the users, which in turn can help them focus their attention and utilize the data presented for their benefit. A great idea is to use a data dashboard, which is a information management tool that visually tracks, analyzes and displays information and metrics. They can be used for anything from application usage to vital measurements to company performances.</p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText newQuestion\">\r\n                            <p className=\"articleQuestion\">Don’t Make Users Remember Information</p>\r\n                            <div className=\"willThisWork\" style={{display:\"flex\"}}>\r\n                            <img src={heart} className=\"tinyImageBox displayCenter\"/>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>Humans undertake a cognitive load when holding short-term information, which can negatively affect their decision making and awareness capabilities. When the goal is to enable the user to make the best decisions with the information they are given, reducing this cognitive load can relieve them from remembering unnecessary information. If your app, website, or interactable service requires the user to take actions or progress between screens, ensure that the user can see the relevant information at every step of the way.</p>                        \r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText newQuestion\">\r\n                            <div className=\"willThisWork\" style={{display:\"flex\"}}>\r\n                            <img src={flowerpot} className=\"tinyImageBox displayCenter\"/>\r\n                            <p className=\"articleQuestion\">Misdirection in Informatics</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>It is important to be aware of some common dark patterns in order to deliberately avoid them when it comes to handling information. A common one associated with displaying information is misdirection. Presenting information that is not relevant to the user or their decisions can distract them from the information they need. Also, presenting information that pulls the readers towards certain pieces of information over others can be manipulative. For example, let's consider an interface that displays information on how to exercise. Examples of misdirection include the usage of bold colors and fonts that emphasize an advertisement to buy exercise equipment versus the usage of grey or neutral fonts to deemphasize free alternatives.

Coming in as a PM, I really had to put into consideration the people that I am talking to. They’re Burmese, a whole different culture, a whole different country, and you really have to respect that. I had to make sure that  everyone is on the same page when I'm speaking to them, so when I do joint meetings with my team and the client, we can discuss progress and updates as respectfully  as possible, that we can understand each other on a professional level. Also, establishing ways where we're able to communicate with each other as effectively as possible and understand each other has also been very important for me on that project. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        \r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    <Col xs={12} md={4}>\r\n                    <img src={star2} className=\"star_background1\"/>\r\n                    <img src={star2} className=\"star_background2\"/>\r\n                    <img src={star2} className=\"star_background3\"/>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n\r\n                {/* ------------------------------------------------------------ */}\r\n\r\n                <Row className=\"fourth_section mobilePadding\">\r\n                <Col xs={12}>\r\n                    <Row className=\"ethicalQuestion\">\r\n                        <Col md={6}/>\r\n                        <Col xs={12} md={5}>\r\n                        <p className=\"article_question3\">From your experience working with Develop of Good, how have they incorporated ethics into their work? </p>\r\n                        </Col>\r\n                        <Col md={1}/>\r\n                    </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" md={7}>\r\n                        <div>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>Well, I think in Develop for Good, we do try to make sure that we're very transparent with each other; we're very honest, open, and welcoming to every person that participates on our team or  applies. We have guidelines for all of our students and our clients as well, because we want to make sure that our clients are willing and open to work with students no matter who they are, and vice versa. Our goal is to match applicants and clients who are passionate about each other and actually want to make a difference and do good for the world. I do try to keep that in mind, in everything that I do, but obviously it depends on the project. You know, some projects do have a much bigger impact on ethics, and ethics have a bigger role in them. Then for others, you know you don't really think or see that as much, but overall I do try to make sure that I'm creating a product ethically, that I do consider all facets of it, in the whole design process and journey too. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText\">\r\n                            <p>And again,  I think my most concrete example of that would be my project for Care Myanmar, because we're working with a totally different group of people in a whole different country. There's a language barrier, differences in customs and how we speak to each other, even through email. The way that I speak to them is a lot different than how I speak normally or how I write emails normally, because I want to make sure that I'm very respectful of them and their time. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <img src = {accent_heart} className=\"heart1\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <img src = {accent_heart} className=\"heart2\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <img src = {accent_heart} className=\"heart3\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <img src = {accent_heart} className=\"heart4\"/>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnLeft\" md={2}>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <Row className=\"fifth_section mobilePadding\">\r\n                    <Col xs={12}>\r\n                    <Row className=\"ethicalQuestion\">\r\n                        <Col md={1}/>\r\n                        <Col xs={12} md={8}>\r\n                        <p className=\"article_question3\">We talked about this with UCSD classes incorporating more ethics classes, but do you have an area in design that you think needs improvement in terms of ethics? </p>\r\n                        </Col>\r\n                        <Col md={3}/>\r\n                    </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    <Col md={4}>\r\n                        <img src={rectangle_frame} className=\"rectangle_frame\"/>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Article Content Column   */}\r\n                    <Col className=\"columnRight\" md={7}>\r\n                    <img src={circle_frame} className=\"circle_frame\"/>\r\n                    <img src={star_frame} className=\"star_frame\"/>\r\n                    <img src={polygon_frame} className=\"polygon_frame\"/>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText beginQuestion\">\r\n                            <p className=\"articleText\">I don't know if there's a specific area because I feel like you should try to bring ethics into every single area if you can. I think that starts at the root of the design process, too. If you're designing a product or something, you should make sure that at the beginning stages, when you're doing UX research or the secondary research, that you’re doing it ethically and making sure that you're targeting the right audience, targeting the right users for the end goal of your product. That could be a specific group of people or it could be the larger range. If you start off with a bad foundation and you don't know who you're designing for, what you're designing for, or even why you're designing, how are you going to design the rest of the product for the people that you’re supposed to be helping? You need to make sure that the beginning stages are done ethically. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost whitespace */}\r\n                    <Col md={1}></Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n\r\n                <Row className=\"sixth_section mobilePadding\">\r\n                    <Col xs={12}>\r\n                    <Row className=\"ethicalQuestion\">\r\n                        <Col md={1}/>\r\n                        <Col xs={12} md={8}>\r\n                        <p className=\"article_question3\">Do you have any advice for any younger students who are interested in pursuing design?

Be brave and go for it , even if it takes you, like me, an entire four year degree of pre-health/pre-med to get to the point where you're finally confident enough to say, “hey, I want to change career paths,” and then do it. You have so much life to live, and it's not the end of the world. You can always change your mind again, too. Just have that confidence and be brave enough to do something that you want to do, and I'm sure that along the way you’ll probably have a great support system to help you. And even if the haters don't follow along, or if your parents are kind of concerned, don’t worry. It's okay, and it's your life. Do what you go to do, and if you're successful with it, then that's all that matters in the end. And even if you're not successful, as long as you're happy, it's okay, really. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className=\"articleText beginQuestion\">\r\n                            <p className=\"articleText\">Honestly, I didn't even think I would get that far with design. A year ago from now, I was just graduating from UCSD.  If you asked me a year ago if I would be here now, I would be, like, “what are you talking about? That’s so crazy. Do I actually have a design portfolio now? Did I actually do all these projects? Am I actually the managing director of UX/UI for Develop for Good? Oh my gosh that's crazy!” So I do reflect back to myself a year ago; I can't believe I grew so much in that time and I did so much, even during a pandemic. So, if you really want something, if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. </p>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                    {/* Rightmost
